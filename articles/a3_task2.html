instant of time in which the latent dynamics changes abruptly, were know
a priori. However, this is often not the case and one might be
interested in inferring them.</p>

<p>We take the <code>xenografts</code> data and we make it ready for
inference by preparing the <code>count</code> column and by dividing the
<code>time</code> column by a factor of 7 (in order to work with a unit
of time of a week).</p>
<p>We select the sample 543, already presented in the previous
vignette.</p>

initialized a <code>bipod</code> object with no breakpoints you can use
the function <code>breakpoints_inference</code>.</p>

<p>The posteriors of the inferred breakpoints can be seen using the
<code>plot_breakpoints_posterior</code> function.</p>

<p>Now that the breakpoints have been inferred one can fit the data
according to the first task simply using the <code>fit</code> function.
Let’s see how it works on one example.</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb6"><pre class="downlit sourceCode r">
<code class="sourceCode R"><span><span class="va">x</span> <span class="op">&lt;-</span> <span class="fu">biPOD</span><span class="fu">::</span><span class="fu"><a href="../reference/fit.html">fit</a></span><span class="op">(</span></span>

<span>  growth_type <span class="op">=</span> <span class="st">"both"</span></span>
<span><span class="op">)</span></span>
<span><span class="co">#&gt; <span style="color: #00BBBB;">ℹ</span> Fitting with model selection.</span></span>

<p>And let’s look at the final result.</p>
