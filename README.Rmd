biPOD is a package to infer kinetic parameters of an evolving population whose size is observed at discrete intervals of time. The tool is able to:

1. Infer growth rates and instant of birth of a population of cells when time windows and change points are known. This includes:
   - Calculating exponential growth rates for different time periods (e.g., treatment phase, relapse phase)
   - Determining the upper limit for the population's birth time if growth is observed in the initial window
   - Handling multiple time windows with predefined change points

2. Identify optimal change points in population dynamics when these transition times are not known, by:
   - Analyzing population size data to detect significant changes in growth patterns
   - Computing the most likely moments when population behavior shifts
   - Optimizing the placement of change points to best fit the observed data

3. Analyze dual-population scenarios typical in treatment-to-relapse cases, characterized by:
   - Inferring separate growth rates for resistant and sensitive cell populations
   - Determining the birth time of the resistant population
   - Calculating the death time of the sensitive population
   - Modeling the characteristic U-shaped dynamics that emerge from the interplay between these populations
