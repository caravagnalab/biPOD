}
\arguments{
\item{x}{a bipod object}

\item{model_type}{character string specifying the model to fit, one of "gauss".
\itemize{
\item \code{gauss} Use a Gaussian approximation. Works well when counts data are far from 0.
}}

\item{prior}{character string specifying the prior to use, "uniform" or "invagamma".
\itemize{
\item \code{uniform} Uniform U(a,b), where at every iteration you sample with width w = (b-a) / g.
\item \code{invgamma} Inverse gamma prior invGamma(a,b)
}}

\item{factor_size}{numeric factor by which to divide counts in the bipod object}

\item{fix_rates}{logical indicating whether to fix rates at values specified in the bipod object
\itemize{
\item \code{1} The birth rate is fixed whereas the death rates are variable.
\item \code{0} Both birth and death rate are fixed.
}}

\item{a}{Minimum value for uniform prior, shape parameter for inverse gamma prior}

\item{b}{Maximum value for uniform prior, scale parameter for inverse gamma prior}

\item{g}{Extra parameters for uniform prior. Sample is done from a uniform centered on the previous
sample and with width w = (b - a) / g.}

\item{prior_K}{Prior mean for the carrying capacity.}

\item{chains}{integer number of chains to run in the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm}

\item{iter}{integer number of iterations to run in the MCMC algorithm}

\item{warmup}{integer number of warmup iterations to run in the MCMC algorithm}

\item{cores}{integer number of cores to use in parallel processing}
