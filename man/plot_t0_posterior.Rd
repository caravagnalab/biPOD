\title{Visualize t0 Parameter Posterior Distribution}
\usage{
plot_t0_posterior(x, add_prior = F)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A \code{bipod} object containing a 'fit' field with model results}

\item{add_prior}{Logical indicating whether to overlay the prior distribution
on the plot. Defaults to FALSE}
}
\value{
A ggplot2 object showing the posterior density plot for t0
}
\description{
Creates a visualization of the posterior distribution for the t0 parameter,
which represents the theoretical start time of the growth process. The plot
can optionally include the prior distribution for comparison.
}
\details{
This function is only applicable when t0 has been inferred during model fitting
(i.e., when x$metadata$t0_inferred is TRUE). The plot shows the full posterior
distribution, allowing assessment of the uncertainty in the estimated start time.
When the prior is included, it helps visualize how the data has updated our
beliefs about t0.
