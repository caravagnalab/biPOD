\title{Generate a Comprehensive Model Analysis Report}
\usage{
plot_report(
  x,
  fit_type = "complex",
  breakpoints_color = "darkgray",
  shadows_colors = NULL,
  t0_posterior_color = "darkorange",
  full_process = FALSE
)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{A bipod object that must contain:
* 'fit' field with model fitting results
* metadata fields with model selection information
* Optional: breakpoints analysis results
* Optional: ELBO values for variational inference}

\item{fit_type}{Character string controlling fit plot complexity:
* "simple": Basic fit visualization
* "complex": Detailed fit visualization with additional elements
Default is "complex"}

\item{breakpoints_color}{Character string specifying color for breakpoint
posterior visualization. Default is "darkgray"}

\item{shadows_colors}{Character vector defining colors for time window
highlighting in fit plot. Default is NULL}

\item{t0_posterior_color}{Character string specifying color for t0 (initial time)
posterior visualization. Default is "darkorange"}

\item{full_process}{Logical indicating whether to show complete process
details in simple fit plots. Only applies when fit_type = "simple".
Default is FALSE}
}
\value{
A patchwork object containing:
\itemize{
\item Main panel: Model fit visualization
\item Secondary panels (if applicable):
\itemize{
\item Breakpoint posterior distributions
\item Growth rate posterior distributions
\item Model selection results
All panels are arranged vertically with appropriate size ratios
}
}
}
\description{
Creates a multi-panel visualization report that combines key analytical plots into a single
comprehensive display. The report can include:
\itemize{
\item Model fit visualization with confidence intervals
\item Breakpoint posterior distributions (if breakpoints were inferred)
\item Growth rate posterior distributions
\item Model selection diagnostics (if multiple models were compared)
}

Each component is automatically included based on the available data and analysis
in the bipod object, creating a tailored summary of the modeling results.
}
\details{
The function automatically adapts its output based on the analyses present in
the input bipod object:
\itemize{
\item Breakpoint analysis panels only appear if breakpoints were inferred
\item Model selection panels only appear if multiple models were compared
\item Panel heights are automatically adjusted for optimal visualization
}
}
