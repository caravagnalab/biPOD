\title{Simulate Population Growth with Logistic Dynamics}
\usage{
sim_stochastic_logistic(n0, lambda, mu, K, steps, delta_t)
}
\arguments{
\item{n0}{Numeric value indicating the initial population size. Must be a non-negative integer.}

\item{lambda}{Numeric vector of birth rates.
This can be a single value (constant birth rate) or a vector of length \code{steps} specifying the birth rate at each time step.}

\item{mu}{Numeric vector of death rates.
This can be a single value (constant death rate) or a vector of length \code{steps} specifying the death rate at each time step.}

\item{K}{Numeric value representing the carrying capacity of the environment. Must be a non-negative integer.}

\item{steps}{Integer value specifying the number of time steps to simulate. Must be a non-negative integer.}

\item{delta_t}{Numeric vector of time step sizes. This can be a single value (constant time step) or a vector of length \code{steps}.
If a single value is provided, it is replicated for each time step.}
}
\value{
A \code{tibble} with columns:
\itemize{
\item \code{time}: The cumulative time at each step.
\item \code{count}: The population size at each time step.
\item \code{group}: A factor indicating the group of contiguous intervals where the birth and death rates are constant.
}
}
\description{
Simulates population growth over multiple time steps using a stochastic logistic growth model.
This model incorporates both stochastic elements and a carrying capacity to describe population dynamics.
